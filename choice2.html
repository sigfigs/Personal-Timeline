        I chose to start teaching others. <br /><br />Throughout my life, I have
        always been a student. However, my position switched to the other side
        in high school when I got my first volunteering job. As the pandemic
        wiped out in-person learning, many young children were lost. Not all
        schools could provide high-quality remote learning replacement, and not
        all children were ready to meet new challenges with fewer classes and
        interactions with their peers. I joined “Remote Buddies” by mentoring
        disadvantaged elementary and middle school students. It gave me the
        opportunity to teach, from which I developed a new perspective about
        learning. Being able to reach out and help those in need made me proud.
        With this teaching experience, I was successfully hired as a paid
        tutor.<br /><br />
        My experiences in teaching showed me that trying something new will
        benefit others but also yourself in the process. High school may seem
        never-ending, but this experience gave a purpose to attending classes
        and studying.
