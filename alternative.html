      <p>
        My biggest fear is losing motivation for my interests, leading to
        procrastination with my work. Even if you don’t perform well in a class
        or other activity, if you have motivation, it’s enough to drive you
        forward – to motivate you to be better. Although I don’t plan on falling
        down this rabbithole, this might happen once I get into college. Many
        teenagers feel as if their goals have all been accomplished and they
        deserve rest and free time for themselves. They might skip classes in
        college, going to parties instead. One action leads to the next and the
        next thing you know, putting off work until the last minute becomes the
        norm.<br /><br />Another choice that might lead to an alternative, worse
        future is setting my goals too high. No one said receiving a high-paying
        position was going to be easy. I’ve had this happen before when I put in
        hours of time with no positive result. I’ve read about blogs where
        people had the same issue. It truly devastates me, but I convince myself
        that these experiences are inevitable.
