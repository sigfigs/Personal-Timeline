        The biggest support system I have are my parents. However, during the
        middle of 8th grade, my father suddenly disappeared. Although I have
        seen this happen in movies and books many times, it was shocking that I
        would experience it myself. Despite the fact that he had never done much
        for my family, I was nevertheless saddened because I would not have a
        “normal” life, as one of the supporting pillars in my life crashed
        overnight. However, I did not let this one instance stop me from reaching my goals. Instead,
        it pushed me harder to become more resourceful and made me more
        resilient and independent.
