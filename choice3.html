      <p>
        I chose who I idolize. <br /><br />As social creatures, humans depend on
        guidance from others. Ever since I was young, I knew that surrounding
        myself with people I know will benefit me and support me through my
        obstacles. <br /><br />At school, I idolize the intelligent, hardworking
        students. The ones who always know what to say when a teacher calls on
        them. The ones who have good study habits and receive straight As.
        Although some say comparing yourself to others is unhealthy, I believe
        it keeps me in check, whether my pacing and workload is too little or
        too much. When I finally make friends with them, we share our
        experiences that led to success. <br /><br />At home, I idolize my mom,
        a strong, persevering woman who supported me my entire life. She’s
        shaped and taught me more than any person through her actions. Her
        circumstances weren’t as fortunate, which motivates me to improve my
        life in the future.
